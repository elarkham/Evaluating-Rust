\chapter{Jacobi Plate Temperature Simulation}
\paragraph{Goals and algorithms.}
For the two programs implemented to simulate a square plate's temperature
distribution over time until the a stable heat was achieved throughout the
entire plate. The jacobi method was chosen as the algorithm to simulate this.
Parallelization of the algorithm was done by partitioning the plate into
sectioned rows that each thread would perform the calculation on exclusively
from one another.

\paragraph{Jacobi Implemented in C++.}
There are three implementations of Jacobi in C++: A Serial version, and two
parallel versions. This was done because the initial parallel version, which
created new threads each iteration, performed poorly compared to the serial
version; The second parallel version instead created the child threads once,
and used semaphores to synchronize the threads each iteration instead. This
second parallel version's performance was much closer to the serial version
when utilizing only a single child thread. It also proved to scale with
additional threads at a rate much better than the first parallel version,
eclipsing both the perfomance of the serial and first parallel version.
