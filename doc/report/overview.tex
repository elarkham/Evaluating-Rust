\chapter{Overview of the Project}
\par Rust is a new programming language being developed by Mozilla, released in 2015
aimed at system application developers. As a new systems language, it has steep
competition with deep-rooted languages such as C++, but it claims completely
memory-safe, thread-safe, and not lose any performance doing so.

\par The purpose of this project was to compare Rust with C++. Rust
was tested to see if it held up to its claims of being nearly as performant C++,
and if the language made writing programs safely easy. These tests and analysis
were carried out using three small programs written at least twice in each Rust and C++. Each
implementation attempted to use as similar an algorithm as possible to solve
the problem at hand, and were used to benchmark performance.

\par The two compilers used for this comparison were clang++ and rustc.
These two compilers were chosen because of their ability to both generate LLVM
IR, which we looked at to see how each compiler implemented language constructs
used in each language.
