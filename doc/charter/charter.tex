\paragraph{Background}
Rust is a new programming language being developed by Mozilla, released in 2015
aimed at system application developers. Many of its competitors such as C++ are
not memory safe and are prone to security problems such buffer overflow
exploits. Rust aims to resolve these issues as a completely new language by
enforcing a strict emphasis on memory safety and program correctness during
compile time rather than run time, while maintaining competitive performance.
The goal of Rust to reduce security problems while maintaining comparable
performance with C++ in concurrent programs will be the primary subject of this
evaluation.
\paragraph{Goals}
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Measure performance of concurrent programs
		\item Analysis of Rust compile time error checking
		\item Evaluation of language ergonomics
	\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}
\paragraph{Scope}
The end result of the project will be a presentation, most likely in the form
of a research paper and or poster, of our findings during our evaluation of
Rust.  We will be implementing 4 program specifications twice, once in C++ and
once in Rust. This will allow for analysis of the differences in performance,
ease of use and generated assembly code of each language. At this time we
intend to implement a concurrent hash table, Jacobi temperature simulation,  Pi
digits, and the Gaussian function. Each program will be implemented to the same
specification in both C++ and Rust; These languages will be alternated between
team members to allow for both team members to evaluate each language.
