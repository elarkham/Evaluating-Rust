	I took the example from hatcher and began modifying the code to allow
	more paramters for analysis of the program. I ran into a particularly
	annoying issue when trying to refactor the thread-creation code; Threads
	needed both constant state and variable state. This meant I couldn't
	just create a worker_context struct to pass in state, but instead had
	to use global variables like Hatcher did with the threads. This is a
	flaw with the design of the pthreads library, which makes writing
	threaded applications with it harder.
