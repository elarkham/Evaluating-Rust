goals not met for this week
- Generate wordfind graphs (Ethan has still not finished his wordfind
  implementation in Rust).
- Analyze pi llvm. The jacobi performance has taken priority, so I began
  analyzing it instead.
- Multi-threaded guassian was not completed, was only able to complete
  single-threaded implementation

goals met for this week:
- Finished Rust gaussian single-threaded

goals for next week:
- Rust gaussian multi-threaded
- Jacobi semaphore
- Compare performance of jacobi semaphore with jacobi pthread.join()
- See if jacobi grid is contiguous memory in Rust, or if there are any other
  bottlenecks making it slower than C++
