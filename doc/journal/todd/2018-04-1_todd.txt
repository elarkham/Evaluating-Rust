goals met for this week:
- Found a hint to explain jacobi performance. Rust vectors appear to perform
poorly when iterating through them in the pattern the jacobi algorithm
necessitates.
- Updated the URC poster to Collette's suggestions.

goals for next week:
- Finish the URC poster
- Run the vector benchmarks on Ethan's server to explain the performance of
jacobi.
