	The C++ hashtable was pretty straightforward when programming the
	non-generic version. There were quite a few errors when programming,
	but the messages were helpful for figuring out my mistakes, nothing
	too obnoxious. One things that is always obnoxious in both C and C++
	is the need to differentiate between '.' and '->' for member access.

	One error that had me stuck for a while, and this is something of an
	annoyance of memory safety and obscure messages, is that an error of
	mine was being caused by "sizeof(this->mulock)" instead of
	"sizeof(*this->mulock)" which was difficult to see when scanning
	through the code, and it caused numerous valgrind memory errors that
	didn't quite indicate the cause.
