The dates of the projects was made to be less specific, and the order of
program implementation has been changed (as reflected on the project charter).
The Hash Table implementation has been swapped with the pi digits
implementation in terms of when its due. This week (10/23 - 10/28) I will
begin implementing the C++ version of pi digits.
