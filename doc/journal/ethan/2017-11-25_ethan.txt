Using a program I got from http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org named
"bencher" I configured my server for benchmarking. This involved creating
custom startup scripts that will minimize the amount of potentially
conflicting processes and installing + configuring bencher so that it will
work with rust programs.
