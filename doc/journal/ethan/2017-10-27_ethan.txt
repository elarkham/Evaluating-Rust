Todd updated charter with less specific milestone dates.

I read through Rust documentation and created some minor test programs
to get a better feel for the language. Since I am the one who will be
implementing the Rust version of pi digits, I will need to understand
the language before I can begin.

My surface thoughts on the language so far are
- It's package manager "Cargo" is simple to use and intuitive
- I am pleased by its use of pattern matching
- Arthimetic is a pain since you can't add floats to ints without
  manually casting one to the other
