Todd and I regenerated jacobi graphs with some bug fixes and
tested the jacobi semaphore version to see if there were any
differences in preformance to the pthreads version. There
was only a slight improvment.

My wordfind implementation turned out to be non-deterministic
so some refinements along with minor bug fixes will need to
be dealt with before we can begin testing it again.
