Me and Todd reran the benchmarks for our pi and jacobi programs. Prior our
data was just based on 1 run vs 1 run, now it compares the averages of
multiple runs instead. Todd also fixed some bugs with the jacobi rust program
that helped smooth out its test results a bit, so retesting for that was
needed anyway.
