I have completed the rust version of the pi digits program.

Since Rust's concurrency system is similar to Go's I mostly used this
Go program as reference: https://golang.org/doc/play/pi.go

Todd/Hatchers version was referenced later in order to better manage
the thread spawning since with the Go-referenced version I spawned
one thread for each interval.

Thoughts while creating the program:
- Was much easier to create and understand than the C version

- Rust's use of concurrency is much simpler and intuitive than pthreads

- I found it very simple to get the program working quickly and then
  cleaned up the code after the fact to be more accurate. Some languages
  (to their detriment) don't allow such technical debt to accumulate and
  as such make prototyping difficult.

- It bothered me that Rust's offical vim plugin overrides my settings to
  force my tab button to create four spaces instead of my preffered two.
  After some research I found out that this is Rust's "official style".
  I don't believe a languages "official style guide" should be by default
  enforced in their IDE plugins that should only otherwise be used for
  syntax highlighting, I am very disapointed in them.

- Language overall was fairly pleasant to program with (exluding the tabs).
