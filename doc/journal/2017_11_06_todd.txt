Wasn't able to work much on the project this week. Instead I was researching
different ways to benchmark analysis and if rust supported them. So far I've
found the following tools/methods in no particular order:
	- gprof
	- operf
	- using CPU wallclock timers in the code
	- valgrind (works with rust)
	- clang++ llvm vs rustc llvm
	- rustc x86-64 asm vs g++ x86-64 asm
