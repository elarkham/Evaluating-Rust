The C++ pi implementation is completed to a degree that will allow Ethan to
begin implementing the Rust version in a similar way. I plan on adding memory
usage and caching introspection to the pi implementation as Ethan begins
working on the Rust version.

Along with implmenting the pi program, I will be looking into revising a
script I once wrote that can graph our data points.
