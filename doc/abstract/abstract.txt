Rust is a new programming language being developed by Mozilla, released in 2015
aimed at system application developers. Many of its competitors such as C++ are
not memory safe and are prone to security problems such buffer overflow
exploits. Rust aims to resolve these issues as a completely new language by
enforcing a strict emphasis on memory safety and program correctness during
compile time rather than run time, while maintaining competitive performance.
The goal of Rust to reduce security problems while maintaining comparable
performance with C++ in concurrent programs will be the primary subject of this
project. In order to do this, the two members of the Evaluating Rust team have
implemented four programs twice, once in Rust and again in C++. Each language
has been analyzed with regards to performance and usability utilzing these
four programs.
