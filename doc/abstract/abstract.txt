Rust is a new programming language being developed by Mozilla, released in 2015
aimed at system application developers. Rust aims to be a completely safe
language enforcing strict compiler rules for memory safety and program correctness during
compile time rather than run time, while maintaining competitive performance.
Many of its competitors such as C++ are not memory safe and are prone to security
problems such buffer overflow exploits. 
This project evaluated Rust as language with regard to its performance, usability,
and safety. Over the course of the past two semester, our team implemented
four programs twice, once in C++ and Rust. Each team-member alternated the
language they were using for each program, and kept journals of how easy it
was to write each program, and if and kept journals of how easy it was to
write each program, and if rust helped them catch errors. Alongside this
subjective analysis, we benchmarked each program for performance, and reveal
why each language performs the way it does.
