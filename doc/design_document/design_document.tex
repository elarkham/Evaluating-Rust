\paragraph{Overview of Problem}
This project aims to compare differences between languages fairly
and display the results in a format that is easily understood while avoiding
any statisitcal pitfalls.
\paragraph{Reason for the project}
%TODO
\paragraph{High Level Design}
The end product of this project will be a research paper, a poster, and a
project repository containing all of the code used to gather the for the report
that anyone can access to reproduce the results. The report contain a detailed
write-up on the differences found between performance benchmarks, differences
between generated assembler, and the subjective report on language ergonomics.
As an aid to the report, the poster will have the most interesting performance
graphs displayed in larger detail, but will omit most of the subjective
language details and won't contain any assembler analysis (due to it not being
graphic in nature).
\paragraph{Desgin Details}
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the project will consist of many small programs, not a
			single large one.
		\item clang++ and rustc are the main compilers to compare since
			they both produce llvm, g++ is secondary but will be a
			good control
		\item pthreads instead of C++ threads are being used
	\end{itemize}
