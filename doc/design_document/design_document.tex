\paragraph{Overview Of Problem}
This project aims to compare differences between languages fairly
and display the results in a format that is easily understood while avoiding
any statisitcal pitfalls.
\paragraph{Reason For The Project}
Since rust is a new programming language that touts its "fearless" concurrency,
we will be comparing and analysing how rust handles concurrency in contrast
with its more dominant competitor C++, using pthreads as its concurrency method.
The hope is that by the end of this project, the advantages of rust's
model over competitors will be brought to light.
\paragraph{High Level Design}
The end product of this project will be a research paper, a poster, and a
project repository containing all of the code used to gather the for the report
that anyone can access to reproduce the results. The report contain a detailed
write-up on the differences found between performance benchmarks, differences
between generated assembler, and the subjective report on language ergonomics.
As an aid to the report, the poster will have the most interesting performance
graphs displayed in larger detail, but will omit most of the subjective
language details and won't contain any assembler analysis (due to it not being
graphic in nature).
\paragraph{Desgin Details}
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The project will consist of many small functionally
			identical programs implemented in both rust and C++.
		\item Analysis of the two languages will primarily be done using clang++
			and rustc since both produce llvm, g++ will be used secondarily and
			treated as a control.
		\item C++ implementations will use pthreads instead of the native C++
			threads.
	\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}
\paragraph{Current Backlog}
\begin{flushleft}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item C++/Rust Jacobi Implementation and Analysis.
		\item C++/Rust Concurrent Hash Table Implementation and Analysis.
