Discussed with hatcher the vector micro-benchmarks, and how they
indicate what may be causing Rust's poor performance in jacobi.

Also told him the current status of the URC poster, which was mostly complete,
and how we aim to have a finished version before our next meeting on Tuesday
which we can review with him before the URC.

We plan to also have some explaination of Rust's poor performance with the
wordfind program by next week as well.
