Attendance: Both Ethan and I were present.

We met with hatcher and discussion the new averaged graphs. Regarding jacobi,
Hatcher seemed interested in exploring even just the single-threaded versions
of each program in Rust and C++.

We brought up the poor performance of the C++ jacobi, and we believe it may be
due to the threads being created and destroyed each iteration of the program,
so we are going to try to see if we can rewrite both the C++ and Rust version
to keep the threads around for each iteration.
