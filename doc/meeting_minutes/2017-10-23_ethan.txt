Attendees: Ethan Larkham and Todd Gaunt

We asked Hatcher if it would be better if we changed our meetings from
weekely to bi-weekly. In the end we decided to keep it weekely but
changed the meeting time for 11:30am to 12:00pm.

Goals:
  - Ask Hatcher if he thought we should change the frequency of our
    meetings
