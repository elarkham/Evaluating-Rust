Attendance: Todd was present.

Ethan was unable to make it today, so I updated Hatcher on what the current
progress with rust gaussian was. I implemented rust gaussian as a
single-threaded program in rust before implementing it concurrently, and the
cocurrent version, along with a semaphore version of C++ jacobi, are goals to
be completed this week.

One suspicion for why the Rust version of jacobi may perform worse is the use
of Vec<T> rather than a primitive array type.
