Attendance: Ethan Larkham, Todd Gaunt

We spoke about the work we did over spring break and reviewed
the work that needed to be done still such as:
-> Refactoring Wordfind
-> Creating Wordfind implementation with concurrent hash table
-> Inspect LLVM generated code for Vectors
-> Working on URC Poster

Considering the work that needed to be done we decided to
pospone indefinetly the Gaussian implementation.

We briefly discussed our work on the abstract and had Hatcher
review it for us. He printed it out and marked the parts
that he felt needed some changes or corrections.
