During our meeting with Hatcher today we discussed the revised project
charter and the due dates of the project milestones. He potentially wants to
be able to digitally sign the charter as well.

Goals:
	- Determine if we are comparing against C or C++, which is best for
	  Rust. C may be all we need / may be more comparable if we don't end
	  up using any of C++'s object oriented features.
	- Add 5th program for second semester to implement and analyze. This
	  will push back the date of the final report compilation.
	- Revise exact naming of the programs on the project charter to more
	  accurately describe their functionality.
